# Matrix Analysis of Structures

This code was developed by Jo√£o Gabriel Duarte (dacos033@umn.edu) to analyze 2D linear trusses.
 
To run this code, do the following steps:

1. Clone this repository;
2. Execute the `main.m` file. 

After successful execution, you should see in the MATLAB terminal:

1. Nodal displacements;
2. Nodal forces and reactions;
3. Members' axial stresses.

In addition, a plot with the original (blue) and deformed (red) configurations should appear on your screen.
